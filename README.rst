    This site auto-generates the little python version badges from url.
    The required  format is:
    https://img.shields.io/badge/[text_block_1]-[text_block_2]-[html_named_color].svg

    It helps to pad with spaces. Characters need to be url escaped (can be done
    using urllib).

    from urllib.parse import quote
    "https://img.shields.io/badge/" + quote("python- {}-blue.svg".format(\
                " | ".join(["3.6", "3.7", "3.8", "3.9", "PyInstaller"])))
